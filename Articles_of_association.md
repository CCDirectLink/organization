# ยง 2 ADMINISTRATION

## 2.1 Division

a. There are two parties: `Community` and `Developer`.

b. Each party has an odd number of representants, no less than 1. Therefore, the minimal amount of members on each party is 3.

c. Both parties can have a different number of representants.

d. All representants are `owners` (or comparable) of this group.

e. There are no `owners` (or comparable) that are not representants.

f. Representants can not leave until a successor is decided by a group decision.

## 2.2 Group decisions

a. Decision taking is done through a voting system, defined below.

b. The following kinds of decisions can be subject for a voting through this subset of articles:
    1. Global group changes (e.g. name, logo, ...).
    2. Additions, removals or changes of representants.
    3. Changes in these Articles of Association.

c. All representants of both parties (`Community` and `Developer`) are voters.

d. Possible votes are: `yes` or `no`. It is not allowed for representants to abstain.

e. Each party has the same amount of votes. The number of votes that each party has in total will be calculated by the least common multiple (`lcd`) of the number of representants in each parties. The votes of each party will be then split equally between each of its representants.
-  _Example 1:_ 3 members on each party. Each party has `lcm(3, 3) = 3` votes. Each representant on both parties has `3/3 = 1` vote.
-  _Example 2:_ 5 members in the `Community` party and 3 members in the `Developer` party: Each party has `lcm(3, 5) = 15` votes. Each representant of the `Community` party has `15/5 = 3` votes. Each representant in the  `Developer` party has `15/3 = 5`  votes.

f. Each representant must vote homogeneously on a single option. Splitting multiple votes between options is not allowed.

g. A decision is determined by absolute majority of votes.

h. In the case a tie occurs, the decision made by the `Developer` party wins.

i. The `Developer` party has always a veto for group decisions, explained in the next section.

## 2.3 Developer veto in group decisions

a. Only the `Developer` party can vote for a veto.

b. At least two representants and 10% of the `Developer` party must request a veto voting for it to be done.

c. A decision is determined by absolute majority of votes made by the representants of the `Developer` party.

d. The result of a veto, if done, must be transmitted to the `Community` party.

## 2.4 Non group decisions

a. The `Community` party votes first.

b. Each representant from the `Community` party can make the following possible votes: `yes` or `no`. It is not allowed for representants to abstain.

c. The result of the voting from the `Community` party must be transmitted to the `Developer` party.

d. The `Developer` party may abstain. In that case, the result of the `Community` party becomes the final decision.

e. If the `Developer` party votes, its result will overrule the result of the `Community` party. Each representant in the `Developer` party can make the following possible votes: `yes` or `no`. It is not allowed for representants to abstain.

f. Vetos are not required for non group decisions.

## 2.5 Request for votations

a. A representant can make requests for votations at any time.

b. At least two representants and 10% of all representants of the party where the requesting representant belongs must accept the request before voting can be started.

# ยง 4 VISIBILITY

1. A forced voting by the community has to be done publicly. This requires that the votes of all representants are visible for the entire community.
2. The final decision of votings product of community requests or group decision must be made public similarly.
3. The individual votes of each representant in a **non group** decision can be kept a secret, unless the decision is product of a forced voting, in which case point _4.1._ applies.
4. The individual votes of each representant in a **group** decision can be kept a secret to the community, unless the decision is product of a forced voting, in which case point _4.1._ applies.
5. All representants can see the individual votes of all other representants in a group decision (`Common voting`).
    5.1. This doesn't apply for vetos: the individual votes of each representant for a veto can be kept a secret.
6. The `Developer` party can decide whether to publish the result of a veto, unless the voting to which it applies is forced, in which case the result of a veto must be published. The votes of the representants can kept a secret, independently of the voting's forced status.
